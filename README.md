### FAQ

- Q: Why can't I see my level in the editor?
    - A: This starter project does not contain meshes, textures, or any other
      assets from the game. This is by design; we do not condone distributing
      assets from the game. This means the in-editor preview is going to be
      largely symbolic. Prefer previewing your map in-game.
